      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>
         Hi Im Neesan. Im a 23 year old Product Designer. I recently graduated with BSc in Product Design from Maynooth University. Ive had a passion for design for as long as I've known, but this passion has only developed over the years. With a keen eye for detail and a deep interest in user experience, I strive to design products that not only look aesthetically pleasing but also enhance people's lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always had a natural flair for design, which spurred my interest in learning more about many creative fields like drawing and graphic design. This desire propelled me into the field of product design as my interests developed. I find it to be an incredibly fascinating challenge to be able to develop practical solutions that solve actual problems. I get a great deal of satisfaction from creating unique, useful designs that solve real world issues. My love for product design is fueled by the constant search for elegant and useful solutions.
